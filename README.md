# TERN
Event simulator with tasks

The Event RuNer is a C++11 event simulator.

Planets wander between event handlers, triggering events as they arrive and depart.

tern.h declares the simulator

tern.cpp implements the simulator

task.h declares specialised event handlers for task orientated simulations ( e.g. packets travelling through a network )

Complete test / tutorial example applictions are in thetst folder.
